<H1>Production and testing</H1>

This document gives a high-level description of the production test process
for <B>atben</B> and <B>atusb</B> boards, plus - in the case of <B>atusb</B>
the production steps required between the boards leaving the SMT line and the
actual testing.
<P>
The testing serves two purposes:
<OL>
  <LI>Ascertain the correctness of the preceding production steps, and
  <LI>identify suffering from random production flaws and either discard
    them or prepare them for repair.
</OL>
The results of testing and fault analysis also provide feedback for the
SMT process and steps preceding it.
<P>
The following diagram illustrates the workflow:
<P>

<P>
Only <B>atusb</B> boards contain firmware and need flashing (which is
a two-step process, see below). The functional tests and further fault
analysis are largely the same for <B>atben</B> and <B>atusb</B>.
<P>
Devices accepted for further use can then be packaged for shipping.
Defective devices can be discarded or retained for a deeper analysis.

<H2>Terminology</H2>

<DL>
  <DT>Ben</DT>
  <DD>a device capable of hosting the <B>atben</B> and <B>atusb-pgm</B>
    boards. In the production process, a Ben can perform three different
    roles:
    <OL>
      <LI> Host an <B>atben</B> board acting as DUT
      <LI> Host an <B>atben</B> board acting as reference
      <LI> Host an <B>atusb-pgm</B> used for flashing the boot loader
    </OL>
    In this document, we assume that a single Ben is used in all
    three roles, with the board in its 8:10 card slot changed as
    the role requires.
  <DT>PC</DT>
  <DD>a device capable of connecting to a Ben via USB, and of hosting an
    <B>atusb</B> board. In the production process, a PC can perform three
    different roles:
    <OL>
      <LI> Host an <B>atusb</B> board acting as DUT
      <LI> Host an <B>atusb</B> board acting as reference
      <LI> Control a Ben via USB (for convenience)
    </OL>
    In this document, we assume that a single PC is used in all
    three roles, with one USB host port permanently connecting to the
    Ben, and a second USB host port populated with <B>atusb</B> boards
    as needed.
  <DT>DUT</DT>
  <DD>Device Under Test. An <B>atben</B> or <B>atusb</B> board that
    has left SMT, and is being prepared for testing or in the process
    of being tested.
  <DT>Reference</DT>
  <DD>An <B>atben</B> or <B>atusb</B> device that is known to work and
    and that acts as a peer for RF communication with the DUT.
  <DT>SMT</DT>
  <DD>In this context, the actual process of soldering components to
    the unpopulated PCB, and all related tasks providing an input to
    this process. Such related tasks include the configuration of the
    SMT line, and testing and conditioning of the components prior to
    soldering.
