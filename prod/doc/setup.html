<H1>Production and testing: Software setup</H1>

Before performing any production tests, various pieces of software
need to be installed on Ben and PC, and configuration settings

<H2>PC software installation</H2>

<H3>Install ben-wpan tools</H3>

<H3>Register Ben host name</H3>

To simplify accessing the Ben via TCP/IP, its IP address should be
registered in the hosts file on the PC. If the Ben is running OpenWrt,
use the following command:
<PRE>
echo 192.168.254.101 ben >>/etc/hosts
</PRE>
<P>
If the Ben is running Jlime, the address would be as follows:
<PRE>
echo 192.168.1.202 ben >>/etc/hosts
</PRE>
<P>
If using the same PC with Bens running OpenWrt and Jlime, one may choose
different host names depending on the distribution, and adapt the commands
used in the production and testing process accordingly. For example,
<PRE>
echo 192.168.254.101 ben >>/etc/hosts
echo 192.168.1.202 jlime >>/etc/hosts
</PRE>

<H2>Ben system setup</H2>

The configuration setting described in this section are lost on each
reset or reboot and either need to be entered again or a setup script
running at boot time has to 
This needs to be done each time the Ben is booted.


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<H3>Enable network access</H3>

Once the Ben has booted and started USB networking, the interface
on the PC side is configured as follows:
<PRE>
ifconfig usb0 192.168.254.100 up
</PRE>
<P>
These are the settings for OpenWrt, assuming the network device is
called "usb0". If using Jlime, the command would be as follows:
<PRE>
ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.200 up
</PRE>


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<H3>Silence other 8:10 card users</H3>

Before running any of the ben-wpan utilities, other users of the 8:10
card slot have to be disabled. In a Ben running the regular OpenWrt or
Jlime distribution, the only such user that is automatically started
is the MMC kernel driver. The following command disables it:
<PRE>
echo jz4740-mmc.0 >/sys/bus/platform/drivers/jz4740-mmc/unbind
</PRE>
<P>
If a WPAN-enabled kernel has been installed, the AT86RF230 driver takes
the place of the MMC driver. To disable it, run
<PRE>
echo spi2.0 >/sys/bus/spi/drivers/at86rf230/unbind
</PRE>


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<H3>Start atrf-proxy</H3>

On the Ben, launch the proxy daemon. We pass the option -b to background it:
<PRE>
atrf-proxy -b
</PRE>


<!-- ====================================================================== -->


<H2>Ben software installation</H2>


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<H3>Password-less remote access</H3>

To enable password-less remote access from the PC, setup to betwork
access to the Ben and run the following command:
<PRE>
ssh ben 'cat >>/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys' <~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</PRE>
