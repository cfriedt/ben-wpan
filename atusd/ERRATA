- changed C7 to 1 nF to debug a signal attenuation problem. Turned out to be
  a bad trace. According to simulations, 22 pF should be more than enough.

- added wire connecting uSD-side ground plane to ground plane at outer edge,
  to improve CLK signal return. (Probably unnecessary, too.)

- the footprint of the transistor (Q1) is reversed :-( It works after
  converting the chip from SOT to PLCC.
