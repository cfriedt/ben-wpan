Version 20100903:

- changed C7 to 1 nF to debug a signal attenuation problem. Turned out to be
  a bad trace. According to simulations, 22 pF should be more than enough.

- added wire connecting uSD-side ground plane to ground plane at outer edge,
  to improve CLK signal return. (Probably unnecessary, too.)

- the footprint of the transistor (Q1) is reversed :-( It works after
  converting the chip from SOT to PLCC.

- not an erratum, but with experiments showing power-on reset to be
  reliable, we can consider removing the hardware reset circuit. This will
  also simplify the layout.

Version 20100908:

- SPI activity causes the PLL to unlock. Specifically, toggling nSEL does
  this.
