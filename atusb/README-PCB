Board characteristics:

- stacking: 2 layers, solder mask on front and back, silk screen on front
- board material: FR4, thickness 0.8 mm, 1 oz copper
- surface finish: TBD, both ENIG and tin are acceptable
- via holes: diameter is nominally 10 mil, but any size <= 15 mil can be used
- mechanical tolerances: <= +/- 0.1 mm on all sides

Layer stacking, from top to bottom:

atusb-SilkS_Front.gto	Front silk screen
atusb-Mask_Front.gts	Front solder mask
atusb-Front.gtl		Front copper
atusb-Back.gbl		Back copper
atusb-Mask_Back.gbs	Back solder mask (empty)

Other design files:

atusb-PCB_Edges.gbr	Board edges, for routing (Gerber)
atusb.dxf		idem (AutoCAD DXF)
atusb.drl		Excellon drill file

Interpretation of files:

- do not print PCB edges on front/back copper
- do not print component values on silk screen
- the center (!) of the board edge line marks the true board edge, e.g.,

                             Edge line (5 mil)
