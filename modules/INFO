# The information for these packages comes from various sources:
#
# - the C8051F326 data sheet, for the QFN28 footprint (N: mcu)
# - the AT86F326 data sheet, for the QFN32 package dimensions (N: txrx)
# - Atmel's general recommendations for QFN land patterns (N: atmel-qfn)
# - NXP's SOT617-1 and SOT617-3, for package and land pattern:
#   http://www.nxp.com/package/SOT617-1.html
#   http://www.nxp.com/package/SOT617-3.html
#
# Known bugs:
#
# - we should distribute the solder paste in an array of small
#   squares instead of just covering the whole center pad.
# - really ought to merge all the various QFN definitions (we have more
#   over at gta02-core) into a single QFN file with a big mean table of
#   everything
