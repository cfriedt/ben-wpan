#
# MMCX board-edge (SMT) female jack
#
# Design based on Molex 73415-0961, This is also compatible with:
#
# Tyco 1408152-1
# Emerson 135-3711-801
# Molex 73415-1261
# Amphenol 262107
#
# Note: footprint changes with PCB thickness !
#
# Known bugs:
# - keepout area marker should be on comment layer
# - pin 2 should be off-center and extend such that proper trace can be
#   connected directly

# USB A plug for SMT
#
# Note: the signal pads are enlarged by 0.2 mm and their center is shifted by
# 0.1 mm with respect to the reference.
#
# According to the data sheet, the leads terminate at (2.00+/-0.10 mm)/2+
# 2.48 mm = 3.48+/-0.10 mm from the center. The reference footprint puts the
# edge of the pads at (2.00+/-0.10 mm)/2+2.6 mm = 3.6 mm+/-0.10 mm, so the
# maximum lead end could be at 3.58 mm while the minimum pad edge could be at
# 3.5 mm.
#
# Assuming that the pad is intended to extend a bit beyond the lead, we need
# to add 0.2 mm to compensate for these tolerances. (The pad tolerance may not
# be intended to be used this way, however, we still have to consider small
# errors in registration, which also amount to about 0.1 mm, so the calculation
# remains valid.)
