IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)
============================================================


IEEE 802.15.4 defines physical layers and a media access control for
wireless networks. ZigBee and 6loWPAN are based on IEEE 802.15.4.

This project aims to add experimental WPAN functionality to the Ben
NanoNote, in order to permit evaluation of overall network performance
and to examine possible integration into future devices.


Hardware architecture
---------------------

IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver chips are available from several manufacturers,
including Atmel, Freescale, and Texas Instruments. These chips are similar
in size, functionality, and cost. The first prototype is based on the
Atmel AT86RF230.

The RF module will be physically placed on the left side of the LCD
module, replacing part of the display's PCB.

When installed in the Ben, the transceiver will connect directly via SPI
to the Jz4720. For development, a SiLabs C8051F326 microcontroller
implements a USB to SPI conversion.
