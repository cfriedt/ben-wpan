Board characteristics:

- two layers, components only on front
- smallest components are 0402 and 0.5 mm pitch QFN
- the following component orientation markings are on the silk screen:
  B1: circle near pin 1
  U1: triangle at the corner between pins 1 and 32
  

Design files:

atben-front.png		Illustration of the PCB's front side (with silk screen)
atben-bom.csv		Bill of materials
atben-pos.csv		Automatic insertion file (front only)
atben-footprints.pdf	Footprint reference drawings

The PCB design files (Gerbers, etc.) are in a separate archive, atben-pcb-*


Interpretation of files:

- for all coordinates, the origin is the lower left corner of the board
- coordinates in atben-pos.csv are in inches
- rotation in atben-pos.csv is in degrees, counter-clockwise
- in the footprint reference drawings, footprints are shown in the 0 degree
  orientation and with their center at the crosshairs
