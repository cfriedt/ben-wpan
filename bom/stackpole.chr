# Stackpole are changing their part numbers, with a transition period from
# 2011-01-03 to 2011-12-31. Digi-Key already went ahead and switched, so we use
# the new style here as well.
#
# Since there's no complete reference for the Stackpole parts with new numbers
# yet, we just put the parts we need here and defer generation until later.
